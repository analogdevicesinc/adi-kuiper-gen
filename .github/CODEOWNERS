# This is the default code owner for 2023_R2 branch.
#
# Since we want to keep this branch in a good shape, commits that
# are not tested, affect the build and/or tests, or do not add any release
# specific bug fix (but feature implementation instead) won't be allowed
# during release stabilization (release cycle).
# 
# All PR's to this branch will require approval from code owners.
#
# Above list will be extended with a developer from each team (repository
# owner) responsible with keeping the branch stable.
